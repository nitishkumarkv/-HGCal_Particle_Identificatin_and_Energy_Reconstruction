Codes for reducing transverse granularity

Details of the files:

1) reducing_transverse_granularity.ipynb : creates xy map for combined neighboring cells for CE-E and CE-H section (for reducing transverse granularity by factor of 4)

2) reducing_transverse_granularity_AHCAL.ipynb : creates xy map for combined neighboring cells for AHCAL section (for reducing transverse granularity by factor of 4)

3) reducing_transverse_granularity_by16.ipynb : creates xy map for combined neighboring cells for CE-E and CE-H section (for reducing transverse granularity by factor of 16)

4) reducing_transverse_granularity_AHCAL_by16.ipynb : creates xy map for combined neighboring cells for AHCAL section (for reducing transverse granularity by factor of 16)

5) create_pkl_files.ipynb : creates new reduced rechit_x, rechit_y, rechit_z, rechit_ene given the xy mapping
